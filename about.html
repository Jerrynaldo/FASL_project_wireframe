          Football. The Association exists to improve the game of football
          constantly and regulate and control it throughout the territory of
          Sierra Leone in the light of fair play and its unifying, educational,
          cultural and humanitarian values, particularly through youth and
          development programs. Also, the Association organizes competitions in
          association football in all it forms, at the national level, by
          defining precisely, as required, the areas of authority conceded to
          the various leagues of which it is composed. And in organising and
          managing, the FA should partner with local or international service
          providers or company in their respective domain of operation thereby
          minimizing brand competition and rivalry
