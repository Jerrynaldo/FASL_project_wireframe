        The Football Agency Sierra Leone is a member of West African Football
        Union (WAFU), Confederation of African Football (CAF) and the
        International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA). It was
        established in 1960 and ha been the only national football governing
        body in the country mandated to administer and manage the running of
        Football. The Association exists to improve the game of football
        constantly and regulate and control it throughout the territory of
        Sierra Leone in the light of fair play and its unifying, educational,
        cultural and humanitarian values, particularly through youth and
        development programs. Also, the Association organizes competitions in
        association football in all it forms, at the national level, by defining
        precisely, as required, the areas of authority conceded to the various
        leagues of which it is composed. And in organising and managing, the FA
        should partner with local or international service providers or company
        in their respective domain of operation thereby minimizing brand
        competition and rivalry
